\section{Introduction}

Minesweeper is a puzzle game with the objective of clearing a rectangular board of hidden mines. 
For each move, the player chooses one cell on the board, revealing either a mine or information about adjacent cells.
The player either wins when all unopened cells contain mines, or loses after revealing a mine.
The game of Minesweeper is NP-complete \cite{kaye}, meaning it is possible to implement a brute-force solver. 
Despite this possibility, a more interesting approach to solving the game is using machine learning.
Our objective is to develop Minesweeper solvers using Q-learning and deep Q-learning.

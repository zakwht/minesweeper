\section{Related Work}

In our initial research, we discovered several reports describing various approaches to solving Minesweeper.
Gardea, Koontz, and Silva achieved up to a win rate of 32\% using a combination of logistic regression, support-vector machines, and simplified Q-learning \cite{gardea}.
Most inspirationally, Stephen Lee outlined his approach to configuring a deep Q-learning agent that reached an 80\% win rate after training \cite{lee}. 
Previous attempts using simple Q-Learning have failed to achieve win rates of greater than 5\% with board sizes upwards of $6\times6$ \cite{mehta}, which factored into our decision to limit the problem to a $4\times4$ board.
